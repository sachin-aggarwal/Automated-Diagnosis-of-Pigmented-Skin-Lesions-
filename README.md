INTRODUCTION: 
 
In this era of Homo Economicus, every country is exploiting resources for growth which is the cause of environmental pollution. These particulates cause damage to the skin resulting in cancer(Melanoma) or tumor(Benign Keratosis). Moreover, depletion of the ozone layer due to air pollution results in larger portion of UV rays entering the earth which is carcinogenic in nature.  
 
Although benign keratosis results in malignant looking skin, it is not cancerous. Whereas, melanoma is. Thus it is a challenging task to identify whether that portion of skin is affected by cancer or not. 
 
 Other organs like lungs, eyes, etc. are also affected by the pollutants but skin being the outermost organ continuously suffers and shows symptoms to the naked eye. So, it is easier to take images of the affected area. And hence can be analysed and predicted by using computers.
